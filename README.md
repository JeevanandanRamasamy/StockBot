# StockBot

A DiscordBot that allows users to simulate buying stocks of companies using an API. Every user can set a starting balance and they can use their balance to 'invest' in companies. When a user buys or sells a stock, the program queries the real-time stock price and uses this value to add and subtract from their balance. Data needed for the operations are stored using MongoDB.
