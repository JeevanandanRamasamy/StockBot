## StockBot

A DiscordBot that allows users to buy stocks of possible companies from an API. Every user has a starting balance, and it is up to the user to make sure that they are investing in stocks in companies that succeed in order to make profit; otherwise, they will lose money if companies fail. When a user invests in a company, they will receive a stock in return.
